You are rebuilding my personal portfolio website to be a modern, clean, and highly professional version of my current site: https://www.waleezaryab.com

PROJECT GOAL:
• Keep the same overall idea, structure, and content sections (Hero, About, Experience, Projects, Contact).
• But completely redesign the UI to look more advanced, sleek, minimal, polished, and premium.
• No restrictions on color schemes, animations, or styling – use your best judgment.
• Make it look like a top-tier modern developer portfolio.

STACK REQUIREMENTS:
• Use Next.js (latest version)
• Use TypeScript
• Use Tailwind CSS
• Use Framer Motion for subtle animations
• Use modern UI patterns (glassmorphism, gradients, grids, soft shadows)
• Fully responsive for mobile, tablet, and desktop

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
• Hero section must be bold, clean, and animated. Include my name “Waleed Zaryab”.
• Smooth scroll animations and transitions between sections.
• Projects section should have beautiful cards with hover effects and animations.
• Contact section should be minimal with a working form (use Web3Forms).
• Add modern navbar with scroll-active highlighting.
• Add professional typography and consistent spacing.
• Make everything feel premium and high-end.

CONTENT:
• Reuse the content and structure from my current site.
• You may rewrite text in a more professional & strong tone.
• Keep my name and identity clearly visible.

ASSETS:
• Add placeholder images or icons where needed.
• Create a clean favicon and minimal logo using text “WZ”.

DELIVERABLES:
1. Generate a complete Next.js project with all pages/components.
2. Make the styling beautiful, cohesive, and elegant.
3. Add animations using framer-motion to the hero, cards, headings, and transitions.
4. Ensure the entire project builds successfully.
5. Provide a final folder structure and code snippets for each file.

TASK INSTRUCTIONS:
• First, analyse my current website.
• Then design the new improved UI.
• Then build the full project.
• Fix any errors and ensure everything works on local and production builds.

You are free to be creative as long as the portfolio stays clean, modern, and professional.
